# Course Contents
The course has five main modules:
1. **Process management:** The first module describes the concepts of process and concurrency and covers methods for process scheduling and interprocess communication. Moreover, it includes a detailed explanation of threads and parallel programming.
2. **Process synchronization:** The second module covers methods for process synchronization and deadlock handling.
3. **Memory management:** The third module deals with managing main memory during the execution of a process. Particularly, this module covers different memory-management schemes that reflect various approaches to memory management.
4. **Storage management:** The fourth module describes how mass storage and I/O are handled in a modern computer system. This module discusses system I/O, including I/O system design, interfaces, and internal system structures and functions.
5. **File systems:** The last module explains file systems that provide mechanisms for online storage of and access to data and programs. It also describes the internal algorithms and structures of storage management.

# Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO)
After passing the course, students should be able to:
* ILO1: Understand the main OS modules, i.e., mangaing process, memory and storage
* ILO2: Apply the grabbed knowledge to implement the given tasks in different OS modules
* ILO3: Analyze the technical merits of a specific OS module

# Course Disposition
The course consists of six modules, where each module covers a different research area in ML systems. Each module has two sessions: one lecture session and one discussion session. 
* **Lecture sessions:** In the lecture session of each module, the teacher will introduce the context and give an overview of the reading material for the week.
The students, then have a week to study the topic and go through the reading material. They are also required to submit a detailed review of the selected papers.
* **Discussion sessions:** During the discussion session of each module, they review and discuss the topic and the papers in depth. The goal of this format is to both build a mastery of the material and also to develop a deeper understanding of how to evaluate and review research and hopefully provide insight into how to write better papers, identify open research questions and need for further research.

# Examination and completion
The course will be assessed with a Pass/Fail grade, based on active participation in the discussion meetings, as well as a scientifically sound review report in each week. 
In addition to this, a passing student must attend at least 75% of all lectures and 75% of all student presentation sessions.

# Recommended prerequisites
The target students of the course are mainly PhD students of the computer science, information and communication technology, and electrical engineering doctoral programmes, as well as all other PhD 
students who are interested to know the architecture and fundamentals of modern ML systems. The students should be familiar with the basics of ML, distributed systems, and have a good programming knowledge 
especially in Python or Scala.
