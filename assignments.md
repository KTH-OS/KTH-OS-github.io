<br>
<h3>Task3</h3>
Task3 is a set of programming assignments relevant to each module. Students should work in groups on this task and submit their code on given dates.<br>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Task4</h3>
In Task4, each group will choose one of the course modules and work on that topic by writing an essay and presenting it to their opponents (another group). This task has several steps:
<ul>
<li><b>Step 1:</b> each group should select a module and study relevant material.</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> each group member should individually work on a subtopic and prepare a presentation to present to the other members.</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> each group should write an essay to explain their findings and accordingly make a presentation.</li>
<li><b>Step 4:</b> each group should study the essay of another group and prepare questions for an opposition.</li>
<li><b>Step 5:</b> each group should present their findings and answer the questions from their opponent group.</li>
</ul>
Grading of this task has the following parts:
<ul>
<li>E: Essay - group grade (weight 50%)</li>
<li>P: Presentation - group grade (weight 20%)</li>
<li>Q: Reviewing essay and asking questions - group grade (weight 20%)</li>
<li>A: Answering questions - individual grade (weight 10%)</li>
</ul>
The final grade is computed as 0.5*E + 0.2*P + 0.2*Q + 0.1*A, where each part's grade is A-F (5-0).
